# teaching_concepts

This collection of hands-on teaching ideas/concepts is intended as a guide and inspiration. All described concepts worked very well in our courses, but we have not done any formal evaluation (through a third party). In our experience, direct feedback from students is substantially more constructive and beneficial for improvements than statistics derived from standard multiple choice questions. While these examples derive from our teaching in molecular biology and bioinformatics, the concepts should be transferable to other fields.


## 1) Reaction tubes as progress indicators in bioinformatic courses

When running bioinformatic courses, participants complete the exercises at different pace. For us it was always hard to distinguish whether participants were struggling with exercises or just chatting with their neighbours. Therefore, we came up with a physical progress indicator. Each participant puts a reaction tube on top of their screen or workstation in a way that it is clearly visible to us. Ideal are 50 ml tubes as they can easily be seen over substantial distances in large seminar rooms. Once a participant completes the exercise, the tube is taken down. The remaining tubes indicate which participants might need attention.


## 2) 'Stupid question' of the day

Students are often reluctant to ask questions even though they have many. There are numerous reasons for this behaviour including a lack of experience to judge the importance of a question and of course the impostor syndrome. To overcome this barrier, our students have to ask at least one question, which they consider stupid, per day. This can be a question about fundamental biological concepts which should be known from previous courses or questions about seemingly minor details of experiments. Students have the option to ask as many questions as they like. The regular discussion of a least one questions increases the chances of solving additional questions.


## 3) Peer-review as a teaching method

When students have to submit written reports or to present their results/a paper as an oral presentation, it is helpful to leave the commenting to their peers. This can be done as a peer-review process, in which each written report is assessed by two or three other students. Different models involve anonymous or signed peer reviews. Previously, we wrote about our experiences with this methods in different courses ([peer-review experience](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2920633/2920815)). However, this teaching method is not limited to written reports, but also applicable to talks and even wet lab work. Students can cooperate in writing their lab reports which enhances their motivation. This teaching method comes with multiple advantages: 1) students are more involved in the process and participate in multiple roles, 2) feedback from peers might be better received, and 3) teaching becomes easier with less time committed to assessing reports.


## 4) Self-selected project results in higher motivation

Students show higher motivation when working on their own projects. Each student is performing a different experiment which feels much more like real research than like a practical course. Previously, we described our experiences in wet lab and dry lab courses ([teaching experience](https://doi.org/10.1515/jib-2019-0005)). As students designed their own primers for small genotyping experiments, they were really interested to see how these primers performed in a PCR. Obviously, it would be very expensive to buy a new primer pair per student per year in a large practical course. However, experiments could be designed in a way that students come up with the same design every year. Just running multiple experiments in one course could be enough to boost the motivation.


## 5) Connection of research and teaching

Frequently, I see students bored by very basic experiments were the result is clear in the beginning. This can be changed by designing a practical course in a way that students can actually do research. Running experiments on the same sample in every year is convenient, but not beneficial for the motivation of students. If we tell our students that they are performing an experiment for the first time and that nobody knows the result, they are highly interested. Although the general concept of the experiment can be similar, the motivation increases when novel samples are analysed. When performing a genotyping experiment with focus on a particular gene/locus, the analysis of novel samples in each year could be enough to spark the interest of students. 


## 6) 3 questions a day will replace teacher on the way

In order to promote autonomic thinking, reflection and planning of their own research project, we like to ask our students at the first 2 weeks of their project modules three questions at the beginning of each day: 1. What have you done yesterday? 2. Why have you done it and did you observe any surprises/challenges? 3. What could be the next step/experiment and how could you use the knowledge you gained so far in the future? With question #1 students are encouraged to repeat the techniques/methods they used the previous day so that they keep their progress in mind and will remember methods easier in the future. Question #2 should teach students trouble shooting and keeping in mind the purpose of each experiment/method. In addition, it should remind them what is important, when performing a specific method, e.g. are there dangerous/hazardous chemicals involved, for which specific precautions need to be taken? The last question should encourage students to plan the next steps and in the end whole experiments by themself. Thereby, students should experience self-esteem and take responsibility for their own projects.
